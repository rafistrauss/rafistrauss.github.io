=====================

Homepage for Github pages, built with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), an awesome new approach to web development.

##About this page
There were 2 reasons I chose to build my portfolio site using Polymer

1. Polymer is awesome. Inspired by Material Design, it looks great and is a robust framework for building frontend apps.
2. It would give me more experience with developing clean, interesting interfaces and utilizing frameworks.

I'd definitely recommend taking a gander at it.
